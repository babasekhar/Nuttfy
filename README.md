## 🚀 Project Overview

**Nuttfy** is an online platform where customers can browse and purchase a wide variety of nuts, dried fruits, and related products.

- **User Authentication**: Users can create accounts, log in, view order history, and manage their profiles.
- **Admin Panel**: Admins can manage product inventory, view orders, and track site analytics.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

We will be using the following technologies:
